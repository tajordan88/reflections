What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, git creates a .git file in your directory, which stores versions of your folder/files in that directory.
You need to do this in order to keep track of versions of whatever files you decide to keep track of.





How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory and the repository in that it holds files you want to commit to your repository
from your working directory. The value that this offers is that you can choose which files from your working directory you want to add in
a single commit, as you may not want to add all your files at once, or maybe not add some at all.




How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change by using git add to add files you want to commit to
the staging area. Then you can use git commit to push these changes to the repository.
