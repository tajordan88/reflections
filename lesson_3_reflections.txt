When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You want to use a remote repository if you want to collaborate with other people on a project.





Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your
remote repository because you might not want to always apply the changes up on your remote repository to your
current repository on your desktop. Your remote repository can be edited by other users and you want to
analyze those changes before you pull them onto your local repository. Perhaps you'd want to pull them onto a
separate branch.






Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks create a copy of another person's repository on your github site. You would use this if you wanted to
get a copy of someone's work so you can work on it, but have it link back to their repository so they get
credit for it. Clones create a copy of a repository from one place to another. You can do this from Github account to GitHub account, or you can do this from Github account to your local machine. You would use this if
you wanted to link your system to another. Branches create a local copy of your current branch (usually master). while maintaining the integrity of the branch you are making a copy of.
