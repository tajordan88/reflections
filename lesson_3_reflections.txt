When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You want to use a remote repository if you want to collaborate with other people on a project.





Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your
remote repository because you might not want to always apply the changes up on your remote repository to your
current repository on your desktop. Your remote repository can be edited by other users and you want to
analyze those changes before you pull them onto your local repository. Perhaps you'd want to pull them onto a
separate branch.
